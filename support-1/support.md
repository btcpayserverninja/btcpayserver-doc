# Support

This project is open source, and is not a company. Instead we rely on a network of contributors and users to provide support.

## Free support

Problem ? Don't worry, someone else has probably been through that before you.

* First have a look at [NBitStack](https://nbitstack.com/c/btcpayserver) for a curated list of topics already answered by the community.
* If your issue is not referenced there, or you want to request a new feature, please open a [github issue](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver/issues).

If you have more general questions about BTCPay, the way it works and why you should use it, you're welcome on our [Slack](http://slack.btcpayserver.org/).

## Paid support

Here are some members of the community that you can contact to get additional paid support:

### Hubik Tomas

> I can help with initial setup/deployment \(currently with Azure, but I am planning to play with non-Azure as wll\) and integration with PrestaShop. I was also playing with design customization of the payment window, scripting of exchange rates etc.

Contact: hubik.tomas@gmail.com

### Spas Vutov

> I can assist with initial configuration for BTCPay to work with Bitcoin Gold \(BTG, also referred as BGold\), Bitcoin Gold LND and any docker, no-docker setup for BTCPay with Bitcoin Gold. I would accept tips if the work done was useful, but definitely not mandatory for anyone to pay me for any help.
